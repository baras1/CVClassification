# Image Classification using PyTorch and NumPy
This project showcases my understanding of image classification through the implementation of different neural network architectures. I have built models using PyTorch and NumPy to classify images, experimenting with various architectures to explore their performance on a given dataset.

Key Components:
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with PyTorch:

Built using PyTorch, this CNN model demonstrates the use of deep learning techniques for image classification. The network includes multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers to process and classify images.
Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) with NumPy:

Implemented from scratch using NumPy, this MLP serves as a simple, fully connected neural network to classify images. It showcases my ability to construct and train neural networks without relying on high-level deep learning frameworks.
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with NumPy:

This model is a CNN written entirely using NumPy. By implementing the core elements of convolutional layers and backpropagation from scratch, this part of the project demonstrates my deep understanding of the underlying mathematics and mechanics of CNNs.
Technologies Used:
PyTorch for building and training deep neural networks
NumPy for implementing neural networks from scratch, including both MLP and CNN models
Matplotlib for visualizing results and learning curves
Scikit-learn for data preprocessing and performance evaluation
Future Work:
Expand the project to include more complex datasets
Integrate transfer learning techniques with pretrained models
Compare the performance of different optimization algorithms
